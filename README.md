This repository is for a Part IV Computer Systems Engineering Research Project developed at the Univeristy of Auckland.

The project is to develop a gamification-based education platform for sustainable agricultural and environmental applications (Project 73).

The project is researched by David Huang & Jesse Zeng

## Project Summary

Our  research  intends  to  investigate  gamification  as  a  tool  to  educate  users  about  sustainable  agriculture knowledge  and  practices.  The  proposed  gamification design  creates  a  virtual  environment  where  users  will learn how to grow a virtual plant and care for it throughout its lifetime. We have selected an apple tree as the focus plant in the implementation as it is a well-known fruit-bearing tree. The user will need to complete virtual actions, including watering and fertilising, to care for the apple tree.

This project is built using Unity for Android devices.
